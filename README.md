<h1 align="center">Welcome to Wordle Discord Bot 👋</h1>
Wordle Discord Bot is designed to let users in your server play Wordle in a channel unlimited times. Players get six tries to figure out a five-letter word, receiving feedback through coloured tiles for each guess, showing when letters match or are in the right position. When a tile is green, it indicates that the letter is in the word and is in the correct position. A yellow tile indicates that the letter is in the word but in an incorrect position. The bot's win streak feature allows players to keep track of their current win streak each time they have won the game.

Once the bot is added to your discord server, just run the following command in the discord channel - where GUESS is your 5-letter guess:
```sh
